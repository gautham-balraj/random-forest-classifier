# Random Forest Classifier from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Random Forest Classifier from scratch. Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning technique used in classification tasks. This implementation aims to provide a simple and educational example of how Random Forest works.


## Introduction

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. 

This implementation demonstrates how Random Forest can be built from scratch using Python, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

## Installation

## Usage

To train a Random Forest classifier using this implementation, you can use the `MyRandomForestClassifier` class provided in `random_forest.py`. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```python
from random_forest import RandomForestClassifier

# Instantiate the classifier
rf_classifier = MyRandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, max_depth=5)

# Train the classifier
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)
```

## Conclusion
Building a Random Forest classifier from scratch provides valuable insights into how ensemble learning methods work. By implementing it without relying on external libraries, we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms. This project serves as a learning resource and a foundation for further experimentation and exploration in machine learning.
